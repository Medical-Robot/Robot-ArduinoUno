/**
 * @mainpage Arduino Library for byte order conversions
 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 * This library provides functions for converting number from native host
 * byte order representation to network byte order (i.e. big-endian byte
 * order) and back.
 * 
 * On POSIX systems, the functions are either defined in <arpa/inet.h> or
 * <netinet/in.h>. However, these header files are not available on Ardunino.
 * This library makes those functions (and more) available.
 * 
 * @note The implementation uses built-in functions of gcc/g++ and preprocessor
 * macros specific to gcc/g++. The library will most probably not compile with
 * any other compiler.
 * 
 * The following functions are provided for conversion from host byte order
 * to network byte order:
 * @li htonll() for long long unsigned integers (uint64_t)
 * @li htonl() for long unsigned integers (uint32_t)
 * @li htons() for short unsigned integers (uint16_t)
 * @li htonf() for IEEE 754 single precision floating point numbers (32 bit)
 * @li htond() for IEEE 754 double precision floating point numbers (64 bit)
 * 
 * The following functions are provided for conversion from network byte order
 * to host byte order:
 * @li ntohll() for long long unsigned integers (uint64_t)
 * @li ntohl() for long unsigned integers (uint32_t)
 * @li ntohs() for short unsigned integers (uint16_t)
 * @li ntohf() for IEEE 754 single precision floating point numbers (32 bit)
 * @li ntohd() for IEEE 754 double precision floating point numbers (64 bit)
 * 
 * @note The functions htond() and ntohd() are only available on platforms
 * which have a "true" IEEE 754 double precision floating point implementation 
 * with 64 bits. In particular, those functions are not available on most 
 * AVR Arduinos, where the @em double data type is only an alias for single
 * precision 32-bit @em float data type. 
 * 
 * @note htonf() and htond() take floating point numbers as arguments and return an
 * unsigned integer of the proper size. ntohf() and ntohd() take an unsingned integer
 * as parameter and return a floating point number of the proper precision. This is
 * modeled after the conversion functions introduced by Microsoft in Winsock2.h.
 * 
 * Each function is overloaded three times, i.e. there are three different
 * versions of each function.
 * 
 * @li Take the number to convert as a single parameter and return the converted number.
 * @li Extract the number to convert from an array of bytes (uint8_t data type) and return the converted number.
 * @li Take the number to convert as a single parameter and write the result of the conversion back to an array of bytes (uint8_t).
 * 
 * @warning The last variant is potentially dangerous, because there is no bounds checking for the target array.
